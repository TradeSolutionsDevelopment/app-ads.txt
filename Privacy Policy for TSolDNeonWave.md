## 1. Introduction & Scope

Welcome to TSolDNeonWave. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is a legally binding document that outlines our practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with your use of our application, which provides 24/7 EDM & Vaporwave streaming, artist links, and a feature-based wallpaper gallery.

This Policy is designed to ensure transparency and compliance with global data protection regulations, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CCPA/CPRA"), and other applicable laws.

**Crucially, this Policy covers two distinct scenarios:**
*   The minimal, first-party operations of the App.
*   The integrated third-party advertising services provided by Google AdMob.

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect (First-Party)

The App is designed with a privacy-minimizing architecture for its core functionality. We do not and cannot independently collect the following:
*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Name, email address, physical address, phone number.
*   **Sensitive Personal Data:** Financial information, health data, genetic or biometric data, precise real-time location.
*   **Device Content:** Your photos, contacts, SMS, call logs, or other app inventories.
*   **User Account Data:** The App does not require registration or login for core features (streaming, gallery, links).

**Local Device Storage:** Progress data for the wallpaper gallery unlock system is stored locally on your device. This non-personal data is not transmitted to our servers and can be erased by clearing the App's cache/data via your device settings.

## 3. Information Processed via Third-Party Advertising (Google AdMob)

To support the development and maintenance of this free application, we have integrated **Google AdMob**, a service that displays adaptive banner advertisements. Google, acting as a separate and independent Data Controller, processes information through its Google Mobile Ads ("GMA") Software Development Kit ("SDK").

### 3.1. Nature and Purpose of Processing
AdMob's processing enables essential advertising operations:
*   **Ad Delivery:** Serving ads within the allocated banner space.
*   **Frequency Capping:** Limiting how often you see the same ad.
*   **Ad Performance & Fraud Prevention:** Measuring ad effectiveness, combating invalid traffic, and ensuring system integrity.
*   **Personalized Advertising (Subject to Consent):** Showing ads tailored to your inferred interests.

### 3.2. Categories of Data Potentially Processed
The GMA SDK may automatically collect and share the following with Google for the purposes above:
*   **Online Identifiers:** Your Google Advertising ID (AAID), a unique, user-resettable identifier for advertising on Android devices. For users on Android 13 (API level 33) and above, our use of GMA SDK version 20.4.0+ declares the necessary permissions to access this ID.
*   **Device and Network Information:** Device type, operating system version, language setting, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular), and coarse location data (derived from IP address, not GPS).
*   **Interaction Data:** Information about your interaction with the ads, such as impressions and clicks.
*   **SDK Instance ID:** A unique identifier for the App instance, used for operational purposes like logging.

## 4. Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR & International Compliance)

Our legal justification for the data processing described in Section 3 varies by your jurisdiction:

*   **For Personalized Advertising in the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and other GDPR-aligned regions:** We rely on your **explicit, prior consent** as the lawful basis under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. Consent is sought via a transparent mechanism (e.g., a Consent Management Platform or a clear prompt) and can be withdrawn at any time with future effect.
*   **For Non-Personalized Advertising and Basic Measurement:** We and Google may rely on **Legitimate Interests** under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is funding the development and free provision of the App. This processing is limited to data strictly necessary for these purposes (e.g., frequency capping, basic fraud prevention).
*   **Under CCPA/CPRA:** The use of the Advertising ID for personalized or cross-context behavioral advertising may constitute a "sale" or "share" of personal information. California residents have the right to opt-out of such sales/shares. We provide mechanisms to exercise this right (see Section 7).

## 5. Data Sharing & Third-Party Disclosure

We do not directly sell, rent, or trade your personal data. However, by using the App, you acknowledge the following chain of data flow:
1.  Data is collected by the GMA SDK integrated into the App.
2.  This data is transmitted to and processed by **Google LLC** as a primary Data Controller.
3.  Google, in its capacity as an ad platform, may share this data with:
    *   Its affiliated companies.
    *   Third-party advertisers and demand partners.
    *   Measurement and analytics providers.
    *   Other entities within the digital advertising ecosystem.

This sharing is governed by **Google's own Privacy Policy**, which we strongly advise you to review. We have limited technical and contractual visibility into these subsequent transfers.

## 6. Data Security, Retention, and International Transfers

*   **Security:** Google employs industry-standard technical and organizational measures to protect data within its systems. As the publisher, we implement reasonable measures to secure the App's codebase.
*   **Retention:** We do not retain personal data collected by AdMob. Google determines its own retention schedules, details of which can be found in its policy. The locally stored wallpaper progress on your device persists until you uninstall the App or clear its data.
*   **International Transfers:** Data collected by AdMob may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or any other country where Google operates. Google complies with legal frameworks for such transfers, such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the Framework, ensuring an adequate level of data protection.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

You have control over your data. Below is a summary of your key rights and practical opt-out mechanisms.

| Your Right (Jurisdiction) | Description | Actionable Steps to Exercise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Opt-Out of Personalized Ads (Global)** | Prevent ads tailored to your inferred interests. | 1. **On Android:** Go to **Settings > Google > Ads > "Delete advertising ID"** or **"Opt out of Ads Personalization"**.<br>2. **Industry Tools:** Use the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out pages. |
| **Right to Access/Portability (GDPR)** | Request a copy of your personal data held by a controller. | For data we control, contact us. For AdMob data, use Google's "Takeout" service or your Google Account dashboard. |
| **Right to Erasure (GDPR)** | Request deletion of your personal data. | Contact us for data we hold. For AdMob data, use Google Account tools. The device-level "Delete advertising ID" function also initiates a reset. |
| **Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Share (CCPA/CPRA)** | Direct us not to "sell" or "share" your personal information. | Use the device-level opt-out (above), which signals to the GMA SDK not to use the ID for personalized ads. |
| **Right to Non-Discrimination (CCPA/CPRA)** | Not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising rights. | We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different quality of service for exercising your rights. |
| **Withdraw Consent (GDPR)** | Revoke previously given consent for processing. | Adjust in-app consent settings (if present) or use the opt-out methods above. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of prior processing. |

## 8. Children's Privacy

Our App is **not directed to children under the age of 13** ("Children" under COPPA) or **16** (the age of digital consent in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal information from Children.

In line with Google's policies for apps not specifically targeting children, we have configured our AdMob implementation to comply with Google's **Families Policy**. The GMA SDK includes design features to limit data processing for users identified as under the age of consent.

## 9. Policy Updates and Notification

We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices, AdMob's services, or legal obligations. The "Last Updated" date at the top will be revised. Material changes (e.g., new data collections, new sharing purposes) will be communicated to you through a prominent notice in the App or via the Google Play Store listing prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of a revised Policy constitutes your acceptance of its terms.

## 10. Contact Information

For any questions, requests, or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us, the Data Controller for first-party operations, at:
